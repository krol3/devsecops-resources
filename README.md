## Good practices Securing the code

- Conformance to process:
  * Code reviews
  * Coding Standards
  * Verifiable builds
  * Test coverage
  * Static Analysis
  * Vulnerability Scanning
  * Verifiable deployments

- Audit Traceability

- Inmutable infrastructure
  * Docker
  * Image OS

- Standard Tooling ??? - Controversial

- Enforce compliance in the pipeline

## Pipeline must have 16 gates
* Source code version control
* Optimum branching strategy
* Static analysis
* > 80% Code coverage
* Vulnerability scan
* Open source scan
* Artifact version control
* Auto provision
* Inmutable servers
* Integration testing
* Performance testing
* Build, deploy, testing automated for every commit
* Automated Rollback
* Automated Change Order
* Zero downtime release
* Feature Toggle

## Security fundamentals
- Vulnerability management (Automating, dashboard)
- Continuous scanning - AppSec Pipeline
- Asset inventory
